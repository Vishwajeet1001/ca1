Git Commit States

1. Untracked:
   - A newly created file that Git does not track yet.
   - Appears in `git status` under "Untracked files."
   
2. Staged:
   - A file that has been added to the staging area using `git add <filename>`.
   - Git is now tracking changes, but they are not yet saved permanently.
   
3. Committed:
   - A file whose changes have been saved in the repository using `git commit`.
   - The commit creates a snapshot of the file at that point.

## Importance of Git History in Version Control and Debugging

1. **Tracking Changes:**  
   - Git history allows developers to track modifications over time.
   - Helps in understanding why certain changes were made.

2. **Debugging and Bug Fixing:**  
   - Developers can find the exact commit where a bug was introduced.
   - The `git bisect` command helps in locating faulty commits.

3. **Collaboration:**  
   - Team members can see previous changes and contributions.
   - Commit history provides context for changes.

4. **Reverting Mistakes:**  
   - If a problematic change is committed, it can be reverted using `git revert` or `git reset`.

5. **Audit and Compliance:**  
   - Helps maintain a record of changes for security and compliance needs.
